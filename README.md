Part 2: Practical Implementation (50%)
Task 1: Classical ML with Scikit-learn

Dataset: Iris Species Dataset

Goal:

Preprocess the data (handle missing values, encode labels).

Train a decision tree classifier to predict iris species.

Evaluate using accuracy, precision, and recall.

Deliverable: Python script/Jupyter notebook with comments explaining each step.

Task 2: Deep Learning with TensorFlow/PyTorch

Dataset: MNIST Handwritten Digits

Goal:

Build a CNN model to classify handwritten digits.

Achieve >95% test accuracy.

Visualize the model’s predictions on 5 sample images.

Deliverable: Code with model architecture, training loop, and evaluation.

Task 3: NLP with spaCy

Text Data: User reviews from Amazon Product Reviews.

Goal:

Perform named entity recognition (NER) to extract product names and brands.

Analyze sentiment (positive/negative) using a rule-based approach.

Deliverable: Code snippet and output showing extracted entities and sentiment.

Part 3: Ethics & Optimization (10%)
1. Ethical Considerations

Identify potential biases in your MNIST or Amazon Reviews model. How could tools like TensorFlow Fairness Indicators or spaCy’s rule-based systems mitigate these biases?

2. Troubleshooting Challenge

Buggy Code: A provided TensorFlow script has errors (e.g., dimension mismatches, incorrect loss functions). Debug and fix the code.

Bonus Task (Extra 10%)

Deploy Your Model: Use Streamlit or Flask to create a web interface for your MNIST classifier. Submit a screenshot and a live demo link.
